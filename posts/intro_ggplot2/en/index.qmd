## Before we start...

This is a material adapted from my class on **Data Visualization** taught in the **Introduction to R** course for my postgraduate program. The aim was not to present **everything** about ggplot2, just the **most important** that can be used in scientific articles.

As this may be useful to more people, I decided to make it available to everyone here. Feel free to share it with others!

:::

## Used packages

In this lesson we will use the following packages📦:

- {dplyr} for data manipulation

- {ggplot2} to create charts

- {ggpath} to plot images in a much easier way

- {pokemon} to get the pokemon table

To install the packages, we use the following script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", 
                   "ggpath", "pokemon"))
```

Now that we have the packages installed, just load them.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpath)
library(pokemon)
```

## The data

To create our charts, we need a dataset. We'll use the {pokemon}📦 package created by [William Amorim](https://twitter.com/wamorim_){target="_blank"}!

```{r}
pokemon_df <- pokemon::pokemon
```

## Charts with R base

One way to create graphs is to use R base itself, which is very simple but allows quick visualizations.

We can create scatter plots, for example.

```{r}
plot(height ~ weight, data = pokemon_df)
```

The problem begins when we want to make these charts more appealing

```{r}
plot(height ~ weight, data = pokemon_df,
     main = "Title",
     xlab = "Mass (kg)", ylab = "Height (m)",
     pch = 19, frame = FALSE)
abline(lm(height ~ weight, data = pokemon_df), col = "blue")
```

It's confusing and I find it very difficult to make any chart like this more appealing.

## Charts with ggplot2

But now let's get to know the {ggplot2}📦 package. This package was the thesis of [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham){target="_blank"}, now Chief Scientist at RStudio/Posit. 

The magic here is that this package incorporated the **grammar of graphics** (hence the `gg`), which brought several fundamentals to be followed. One of them is the creation of graphics in layers, as if it were a painting!

![Source: QCBS R Workshop Series](figures/gglayers.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}

This package is already included in the {tidyverse}📦 and follows the same principle.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

If we just run `ggplot()`, we'll get a blank canvas.

```{r}
ggplot()
```

Now we have to add our dataset and what our axes will be.

Whenever we are talking about a **variable** from our dataset, we have to put it inside the `aes()` argument, which stands for **aesthetics**.

```{r}
ggplot(data = pokemon_df,
       aes(x = weight,
           y = height))
```

In fact, as ggplot2 works in layers, we can use it as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = pokemon_df)+
  aes(x = weight,
      y = height)
```

As **ggplot2** is part of the {tidyverse}📦, we can tell R in the imperative: *"Get the dataset `pokemon_df` and then create the ggplot..."*. The good thing about this approach is that, as ggplot already knows the dataset beforehand, it helps us select the variables (press `tab` before writing the variables).

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight,
             y = height))
```

Now we have our chart with the axes delimited, and we can add as many layers as we like. The principle of ggplot is similar to pipe, where the information is passed directly to the layer below, so we don't need to add the data again.

### Geometries

Geometries are functions that start with `geom_*`. There are lots of them and we can get a little help with [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf){target="_blank"}.

First, let's create a scatterplot

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight,
             y = height))+
  geom_point()
```

To add another layer of geometry, just add another layer to this canvas. Let's add a trend line with the `geom_smooth()` function.

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight,
             y = height))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
```

We can add a linear trend line with the argument `method = "lm"`!

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight,
             y = height))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Here we can see how ggplot2 works like a painting. As `geom_smooth()` was called **after** `geom_point()`, it is plotted on top. 

Let's look at the same example but inverting these geometries.

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight,
             y = height))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  geom_point()
```

Let's make a boxplot (using the `geom_boxplot()` geometry) of the type of pokemon by height
```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1, y = height))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now let's make a column chart (using the `geom_col()` geometry) of the pokemons' attacks.

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pokemon, y = attack))+
  geom_col()
```

Whoa! We have a lot of data! Let's filter only the starter pokemons and their evolutions to plot.

```{r}
starters <- pokemon_df %>% 
  filter(id %in% 1:9)
```

Let's test it!

```{r}
starters %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pokemon, y = attack))+
  geom_col()
```

We can invert the axes, just switch. Especially with large texts, it's best to keep them on the y-axis.

```{r}
starters %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon))+
  geom_col()
```

The pokemons are not in the order we would like (as in the dataset), they are in alphabetical order. So we have to sort them by `id`, but to be sorted we need to consider them as factors.

```{r}
starters2 <- starters %>% 
  mutate(pokemon = reorder(pokemon, id))
```

Let's see if it worked using the dplyr::glimpse() function. Note the class of each variable between `<...> `

```{r}
glimpse(starters2)
```

Look how it's sorted now!

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon))+
  geom_col()
```

These charts are missing **colors**!

Now let's use the `color` and `fill` arguments. When the shape is solid, we only use `color`, if it has an outline and a filling, we use `color` and `fill`, respectively.

We can color according to any variable, in this case we'll color by **type**!

Note that we can determine the variable in the `ggplot()` function and it will be used for all the following ones. If we only want to apply it to a single layer, we only add it to that layer.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col()
```

Now we can add the outline. As it's not a variable (it's a fixed color), it doesn't have to go inside `aes()`

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")
```

### Labels

Every chart can have a title, subtitle, caption, axis title, etc.

All this can be determined using the `labs()` function within ggplot. Note that the legend is created according to the `fill` variable, so the title of the legend will follow this variable.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  labs(
    title = "The starter pokemons",
    subtitle = "Separated by type",
    caption = "Bruno Mioto",
    x = "Attack",
    y = "Pokemon",
    fill = "Type"
  )
```

### Scales

What if we want to edit the scales? In that case we'll use the `scale_*` set of functions.

Let's edit the X axis. The breaks are every 20 attack points, let's put them every 10 points. As the x-axis is continuous, we'll use the `scale_x_continuous()` function. The `breaks` argument helps us with this task!

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,200,10))
```

Colors can also be defined using the `scale_*` function. These colors are not exactly what we want, we can define them manually using the `scale_fill_manual()` function.

As the colors are defined according to type, we'll use them as a basis. The dataset itself provides the colors for each type. For the **water** type we'll use the color `#6890F0`, for the **fire** type we'll use the color `#F08030` and for the **grass** type we'll use the color `#78C850`.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )
```

In addition to defining the colors, we can also determine the labels that each color will have in the legend. We'll do this within the `scale` function too, but with the `labels` argument.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "fire" = "Fire",
      "grass" = "Grass",
      "water" = "Water"
    )
  )
```

### Themes

But these charts aren't so pretty yet, we can edit **anything** in the charts, from the background color to the font!

ggplot2 already has some pre-defined themes. Let's try them out

This is `theme_bw()`

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme_bw()
```

I really like `theme_classic()`

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme_classic()
```

`theme_minimal()` is also widely used.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme_minimal()
```

The `theme_void()` maintains **only** the geometries of the generated chart.

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme_void()
```

But we can edit anything within the chosen theme too. These functions are just predetermined configurations.

Most of the parameters can be seen [on this website](https://ggplot2tor.com/theme){target="_blank"}. To change the theme parameters, we add the arguments to the `theme()` function.

Let's delete the title of the axes!

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank()
  )
```

Or change the background of the chart. Notice that we have `plot` (the whole chart) and `panel` (just the panel between the axes)

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "yellow")
  )
```

Let's change the grid lines!

```{r}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "yellow",
                                    color = "blue"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "green"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dashed"),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = "black")
  )
```

Oh my goodness! The chart isn't pretty, but it's didactic! (But don't ever do something like that for real, please)

### Facets

We often have a lot of information to show in just one chart. For this we can use the idea of **small multiples** with the `facet_wrap()` function!

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, 
             y = defense, 
             color = generation_id))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(.~generation_id)
```

In this case, ggplot interpreted the `generation_id` column as a continuous number. But in this case each **generation** is independent of another. We can tell ggplot2 to interpret this variable as a **factor**.

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, 
             y = defense, 
             color = factor(generation_id)))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(.~factor(generation_id))
```

We can use the facets with other data too.

```{r}
pokemon_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, 
             y = defense, 
             color = type_1))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(.~type_1)
```

## Plotting images

If we want to put images in our charts, the best indication is to use the package {ggpath}📦. This is the best way to plot images!

To do this, use the `geom_from_path()` function. All we need to do is enter the column with the path to the picture.

One suggestion is to set the `width` argument to 0.1 as the pictures can get **big**!

```{r ggpath, warning=FALSE}
library(ggpath)

starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  geom_col(color = "black")+
  geom_from_path(aes(path = url_image),
                 width = 0.1)+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )
```

### Chart finished

Here I've added a few finishing touches to our chart (check the positioning of the names and figures!). Unfortunately it's not for this post to go into all these details, but I've left **everything** in the comments!

```{r final}
starters2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attack, y = pokemon, fill = type_1))+
  #add columns
  geom_col(color = "black",
           width = 0.5)+
  #add names
  geom_text(aes(label = pokemon,
                color = type_1),
            x = 1,
            hjust = 0, #side alignment
            nudge_y = 0.45, #vertical adjustment
            fontface = "bold"
            )+
  #add figures
  geom_from_path(aes(path = url_image),
                 width = 0.1, #width relative to total
                 hjust = 0 #side alignment
                 )+
  #add vertical line
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+
  #expand x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0,0.1)) #expand left-right
  )+
  #edit colors (will affect text that uses color)
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  #edit colors (will affect the column that uses fill)
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "water" = "#6890F0",
      "fire" = "#F08030",
      "grass" = "#78C850"
    )
  )+
  #edit labs
  labs(
    x = "Attack",
    caption = "Bruno Mioto - @BrunoHMioto"
  )+
  #use initial theme
  theme_classic()+
  #edit theme
  theme(
    #remove all subtitles
    legend.position = "none",
    #remove y-axis title
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    #remove text from y-axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    #remove ticks
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    #remove axes
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    #add grid line - major
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(),
    #add dotted grid line - minor
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(linetype = "dashed"),
    #increase plot margins
    plot.margin = margin(10,10,10,10,"pt"),
    #change the color of the plot background
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f1f1f1", color = NA),
    #change the background color of the panel
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f1f1f1", color = NA)
  )+
  #doesn't crop the images that come out of the panel
  coord_cartesian(
    clip = "off"
  )

```

Everything we've seen so far is the basics of the basics in ggplot2, but it already allows us to do a lot of cool stuff! There are several examples of charts with ggplot2 [here](../../../charts.qmd), and some ready-made [scripts](../../../scripts.qmd) here!
